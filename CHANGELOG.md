## [Unreleased]

### Added — Analysis rule engine for hypothesis evaluation

New `gnat/analysis/rules/` package implementing a declarative Hy-based
rule engine that evaluates `analysis.Hypothesis` objects and returns
status transition decisions (OPEN → SUPPORTED, REFUTED, INCONCLUSIVE).

- `AnalysisRuleEngine.evaluate()` — priority-sorted rule evaluation
  with phase gates, transition-slot semantics, dirty-tree refusal in
  production, exception logging (never halts). Returns decisions
  without mutating state.
- `RuleOrchestrator` — bridges engine to InvestigationService with
  audit-first pattern. Writes all firing records before applying the
  primary decision.
- `AuditWriter` — rule_firing_audit table (alembic 0010) with git SHA
  capture, in-memory fallback when SQLAlchemy unavailable.
- `EvidenceResolver` — batch-resolves STIX IDs to source_platform and
  TRUST_LEVEL via WorkspaceStore + CLIENT_REGISTRY. Per-eval cache.
- `RuleEnginePolicy` — 7-field config from INI `[rules]` section with
  `GNAT_ALLOW_DIRTY_RULES=1` env override. Feature flag default OFF.
- 26 helper functions in 6 modules: evidence (counts, ratio),
  confidence (Admiralty Scale, band), temporal (staleness, freshness),
  status, policy (AI-60 ceiling), source (trust levels, AI-only).
- `defrule` Hy macro + `set-status`/`annotate`/`no-op` constructors.
- Hy helper surface re-exporting all Python helpers with Lisp naming.
- `RuleLoader` with directory walking, priority sort, stat-on-call
  hot reload, graceful fallback when Hy not installed.
- `RuleEngineProtocol` (typing.Protocol) + `create_engine()` factory.
- `IS_AI_CONNECTOR = True` added to ChatGPT and Copilot connectors.
- 3 production reference rules + 4 examples in `rules/` directory.
- ADR-0054 documenting all architectural decisions.
- 4 Diataxis docs: tutorial, how-to, spec, explanation.
- pyproject.toml `[rules]` extras group (`hy>=1.0`).
- 123 tests, all passing.

### Added — Cuckoo Sandbox / CAPEv2 connector

New `gnat/connectors/cuckoo/` connector for dynamic malware analysis.
Supports both the legacy Cuckoo 2.x API (`/api/`) and CAPEv2/3.x
(`/apiv2/`) with auto-detection at `authenticate()` time. Platform
count: 158 → 159.

- `CuckooClient` — Bearer token auth. STIX type map: observed-data,
  malware, indicator. Version-specific endpoint routing via
  `self._prefix`. Auto-detection probes `/apiv2/cuckoo/status/` first
  (CAPEv2 is more common); falls back to v2 on failure. Optional
  `api_version` constructor override skips detection.
- Domain helpers: `submit_file()`, `submit_url()`, `get_report()`,
  `get_task_view()`, `get_iocs()`, `iocs_to_indicators()`,
  `list_machines()`, `get_pcap()`.
- IOC extraction: walks `network.hosts` (IPs), `network.domains`
  (domains), `network.http` (URLs), `dropped` (SHA-256 hashes),
  `network.dns.answers` (resolved IPs), and CAPEv2
  `signatures[*].marks[*].ioc` (signature-extracted IOCs).
  Deduplicates by type+value.
- STIX mapping: `sandbox_report_envelope()` for observed-data with
  processes, contacted IPs/domains/URLs, verdict from score mapping
  (0-3→clean, 4-6→suspicious, 7+→malicious). Malware SDO from
  `malfamily`/`detections` fields. Indicator SDOs via
  `make_indicator_pattern()`.
- 22 new tests in `TestCuckooClient`.

### Added — Sensor/telemetry ingestion module (`gnat[telemetry]`)

New `gnat/ingest/telemetry/` package for high-volume honeypot, netflow,
IDS alert, and DNS log ingestion. Install with `pip install "gnat[telemetry]"`.

- `KafkaSourceReader` — `SourceReader` subclass consuming JSON-encoded
  messages from Kafka topics. Supports `max_messages` cap, configurable
  consumer group, and extra `consumer_config` kwargs. Kafka metadata
  (`_kafka_topic`, `_kafka_partition`, `_kafka_offset`) attached to each
  raw record.
- `SensorSchema` — normalises five sensor types (honeypot, netflow,
  IDS alert, DNS log, generic) into a common `SensorEvent` dataclass.
  Supports both common field names (`src_ip`) and vendor-specific names
  (e.g. `IPV4_SRC_ADDR` for NetFlow).
- `TelemetryMapper` — `RecordMapper` producing STIX Indicators for
  source IPs, destination IPs (opt-in), domains, URLs, and file hashes
  (MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 auto-detected by length). Filters RFC 1918 private
  addresses. Severity gating for IDS alerts (`min_severity` parameter).
  Attaches `x_gnat_sensor_type`, `x_gnat_sensor_id`, and `x_gnat_signature`
  custom properties.
- `RedisDeduplicationCache` — SHA-256 fingerprint dedup via Redis SET
  operations with TTL-based expiry. Falls back to in-memory set when
  Redis is unavailable (`fallback_to_memory=True` default).
- `CampaignLinker` — pipeline transform (`IngestPipeline.transform()`)
  that auto-links ingested indicators to active campaigns by matching
  IOC values against a pre-built reverse index. Builds the index lazily
  from `CampaignService.list(status=ACTIVE)` on first call.
- `pyproject.toml` — new `[telemetry]` extras group:
  `kafka-python-ng>=2.2, redis>=5.0`.
- 37 new tests in `tests/unit/ingest/test_telemetry.py`.

### Added — Infrastructure graph labels on EvidenceGraph

Wires the existing `InfrastructureClassifier` into the evidence graph
correlator to automatically label OBSERVABLE nodes with infrastructure
roles (C2, staging, exfiltration, delivery, proxy, credential_harvest).

- `EvidenceNode.infrastructure_roles` — new `list[str]` field on
  evidence nodes, analogous to `campaign_labels`.
- `EvidenceGraph.by_infra_role` — new correlation index mapping
  role string → list of node IDs, following the `by_ioc`/`by_campaign`
  pattern.
- `classify_infrastructure(graph)` — walks OBSERVABLE nodes, extracts
  IOC type/kill-chain/port hints from STIX dicts, delegates to
  `InfrastructureClassifier.classify()`, populates node fields and
  graph index. Auto-called at the end of `correlate()`.
- `GraphQuery.filter(infra_roles=...)` — new optional parameter
  retaining only nodes with matching infrastructure roles.
- `GraphContext.to_dict()` — includes `infrastructure_roles` in
  serialised node output when present.
- `POST /api/graph/infrastructure` — new FastAPI endpoint returning
  role-to-node-ID mapping and counts.
- `EvidenceGraph.summary()` — includes `infrastructure_roles` counts.
- 30 new tests across `test_correlator_infra.py`, `test_graph.py`,
  and `test_graph_infra_endpoint.py`.

### Added — HuntGNAT: STIX → detection rule translation (Phases 1–4)

New `gnat/plugins/huntgnat/` plugin providing end-to-end STIX indicator
pattern to platform-native detection rule translation, hunt package
management, ATT&CK coverage analysis, deployment tracking, and
validation scoring.

**Phase 1 — Pattern parser + translators**
- Recursive descent STIX pattern parser producing typed AST (ObjectPath,
  Comparison, ComparisonExpr, Observation, CompoundObservation).
- `SigmaTranslator` — logsource-aware YAML rules with field-name
  resolution and detection logic mapping.
- `YaraHashTranslator` — hash-based file detection rules for
  MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 indicators.
- `SuricataTranslator` — network alert rules; rejects host-only
  patterns via `UntranslatableError`.
- `SnortTranslator` — Snort 3 IPS rules.
- `translate()` / `translate_all()` dispatch API.
- `RuleLanguage` enum, `TranslationResult` dataclass with SHA-256
  rule hash, `UntranslatableError` contract.
- 53 tests in `tests/unit/plugins/test_huntgnat.py`.

**Phase 2 — Hunt packages + ATT&CK coverage**
- `HuntPackage` — STIX Grouping (`context="x-huntgnat-hunt-package"`)
  with lifecycle state machine (DRAFT → PEER_REVIEWED → ACTIVE →
  RETIRED). Links hypotheses, evidence, indicators, attack patterns,
  campaign, rules, and techniques.
- `CoverageAnalyzer` — builds ATT&CK technique × rule coverage
  matrices from hunt package collections. `find_gaps(platform=)` for
  platform-specific gap analysis.

**Phase 3 — Deployment tracking + drift detection**
- `Deployment` — tracks rule deployments to platforms (Splunk,
  Sentinel, CrowdStrike, Elastic).
- `DriftDetector` — SHA-256 hash comparison of canonical vs
  on-platform rule bodies. Produces `DriftEvent` on divergence.
- `Sighting` — STIX Sighting SDO for detection firing events.

**Phase 4 — Validation**
- `ValidationRun` — executes ATT&CK techniques against lab
  infrastructure and scores rule firings as
  FIRED/MISSED/TIMEOUT/ERROR/SKIPPED.
- `RuleValidationResult` with pass rate computation.
- 30 tests in `tests/unit/plugins/test_huntgnat_phases234.py`.

### Added — Attribution & campaign tracking (core extension)

New `gnat/analysis/attribution/` package providing formal campaign
management, competing attribution hypotheses, Diamond Model analysis,
kill-chain tracking, infrastructure classification, and actor profiles.

- `Campaign` ORM (`gnat/orm/campaign.py`) — STIX `campaign` SDO.
- `CampaignProfile` — enriched analytical wrapper with status lifecycle
  (SUSPECTED → ACTIVE → DORMANT → CONCLUDED), indicator/cluster/
  investigation linkage, and full to_dict/from_dict roundtrip.
- `CampaignService` — CRUD + status transitions + indicator/cluster/
  investigation linking.
- `CampaignStore` — SQLAlchemy persistence (indexed metadata + JSON
  blob pattern).
- `AttributionHypothesis` + `AttributionEngine` — competing
  attributions with NATO Admiralty Scale confidence scoring,
  evidence tracking, confidence history snapshots, and AI confidence
  ceiling at 60.
- `ActorProfile` — capability matrix (technique × proficiency),
  targeting history, alias management with source+confidence per alias,
  infrastructure pattern signatures, MITRE group ID cross-reference.
- `DiamondVertex` + `DiamondAnalyzer` — formal ACIV
  (Adversary-Capability-Infrastructure-Victim) tuples with pivot point
  detection for shared infrastructure.
- `KillChainProgression` + `KillChainTracker` — 14-phase ATT&CK tactic
  ordering with coverage percentage, deepest phase reached, and gap
  analysis.
- `InfrastructureRole` enum + `InfrastructureClassifier` — rule-based
  classification (C2/staging/exfiltration/delivery/proxy/credential
  harvest) from kill-chain phases, STIX infrastructure_types, and port
  heuristics.
- `CampaignBuilder` — promotes `ClusterDetector` clusters to formal
  campaigns with automatic indicator/technique linkage.
- `gnat campaign` CLI (7 subcommands: list, create, show, transition,
  link, attribute, promote-cluster).
- `gnat actor` CLI (5 subcommands: list, create, show, alias,
  capability).
- 142 new tests across 4 test files (attribution, hypothesis,
  diamond/killchain/infra, campaign builder, CLI).

### Added — `gnat schedule` CLI with hybrid YAML + Python-module loader

The `gnat schedule` subcommand group, which had been registered but
stubbed since v1.4, is now fully implemented. The scheduler engine
itself (`FeedScheduler`, `FeedJob`, `WorkflowJob`) was already feature
complete — what was missing was a way for the CLI to **find** the
user's job definitions. This release adds a hybrid loader that accepts
both declarative YAML and Python modules, freely mixable in the same
deployment.

**New module: `gnat/schedule/loader.py`**
- `load_scheduler(config, jobs_file=None, jobs_module=None, skip_client_init=False)`
  — returns a fully-populated `FeedScheduler` ready to start. Resolution
  order: explicit kwargs override `[schedule]` config-section values
  override "no source" (which raises `ScheduleLoaderError`).
- YAML schema: top-level `jobs:` list where each entry has `id`,
  `reader: {class, args}`, `mapper: {class, args}`, either
  `interval_seconds` or `cron`, plus optional `client`, `enabled`,
  `confidence`, `tlp_marking`, `deduplicate`, `dedup_key_fields`,
  `overlap_policy`, `max_history`, `description`. Classes are resolved
  at load time via `importlib.import_module` so typos fail fast.
- Python-module path: the loader looks for `build_jobs(config)`,
  `build_jobs()`, a module-level `scheduler: FeedScheduler`, or a
  module-level `jobs: list[FeedJob]` — in that order. The first match
  wins, so the same module can start simple (plain list) and grow into
  a factory function without breaking the loader contract.
- Hybrid mode: set both `jobs_file` and `jobs_module` and every source's
  jobs are merged into a single scheduler. Typical layout: put simple
  "fetch URL every hour" feeds in YAML for ops PR review; put
  credential-heavy or tenant-scoped jobs in the Python module.
- Client resolution for YAML jobs: when a job specifies `client: <name>`
  the loader instantiates the matching connector class from
  `CLIENT_REGISTRY` using the `[<name>]` section of the passed
  `ConfigParser` — no disk re-read, no surprise auth call. Eager
  instantiation lets `gnat schedule validate` catch unknown-client typos
  before the scheduler ever runs. `skip_client_init=True` short-circuits
  this path for credential-free lint passes in CI.

**New CLI subcommands (`gnat schedule ...`)**

All seven share `--jobs-file PATH` / `--jobs-module DOTTED.PATH`
overrides and honor the global `--output json` flag for machine-readable
output:

- `list` — one-line-per-job table with id, enabled flag, schedule
  expression, health, run count, last run, next run.
- `status --job ID` — detailed single-job view with the last 5 runs
  from `job.history` in a sub-table.
- `history --job ID [--limit N]` — full run-history table (default
  last 20) showing scheduled/started/duration/status/records/error
  per `RunRecord`.
- `run [--job ID] [--parallel]` — trigger one or all jobs immediately.
  Returns exit code 1 if any job failed, 0 otherwise. Uses
  `scheduler.run_now()` / `scheduler.run_all_now(parallel=)`.
- `crontab [--command CMD]` — emit crontab lines via
  `scheduler.to_cron_lines()`. Defaults to `gnat schedule run --job
  {id}` per line; override with `--command '/path/to/my-runner'` for
  non-default wrappers.
- `validate` — parse job definitions without instantiating any
  `GNATClient`, catching class-path typos, cron syntax errors, and
  missing `[schedule]` config sections. Designed for CI pre-commit
  hooks — zero credentials required.
- `start [--run-immediately]` — foreground scheduler loop with signal
  handling for clean Ctrl-C / SIGTERM shutdown. The handler installs
  `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` handlers, drops into a 1-second `time.sleep`
  loop, and calls `scheduler.stop()` from a `finally` block on exit.
  Designed to sit behind systemd / Docker / supervisord; GNAT does
  **not** implement its own daemonization.

**Ancillary changes**
- `gnat/schedule/__init__.py` — export `load_scheduler` and
  `ScheduleLoaderError` as top-level names.
- `gnat/config.py` — new public `GNATConfig.parser` property that
  returns the underlying `configparser.ConfigParser`. The loader uses
  this to read the `[schedule]` section and resolve per-connector
  credentials consistently with the rest of the CLI.
- `config/config.ini.example` — new commented `[schedule]` section
  documenting the `jobs_file` and `jobs_module` keys.
- `docs/how-to/schedule-feeds.md` — rewrote the intro to cover the
  CLI and the two loader modes; preserved the existing
  programmatic-API examples under a "Programmatic API (no CLI)"
  heading.

**Design decisions (captured here because there's no ADR)**
- **Argparse quirk fixed:** the initial `--command` flag on the
  `crontab` subparser clobbered the top-level `dest="command"` because
  argparse's subparser actions merge dests by default. Resolved by
  setting `dest="cron_command"` on the flag (user-facing name
  unchanged).
- **No built-in daemonization.** The `start` command is foreground-only
  — any production deployment should put it behind systemd, Docker, or
  supervisord. Reinventing PID-file handling, signal trees, zombie
  reaping, and log rotation inside GNAT was explicitly rejected as a
  tar pit; the how-to doc ships systemd and Docker examples instead.
- **No `schedule add-job` CLI.** Declarative YAML *is* the job-editing
  interface — editing YAML is cleaner than CLI-generating stateful
  config, and it keeps jobs reviewable in PRs. The Python-module
  escape hatch exists for everything YAML can't express.

**Tests**
- 35 new tests in `tests/unit/schedule/test_loader.py` covering YAML
  happy paths (interval vs cron, optional fields, multiple jobs),
  YAML error paths (missing file, bad YAML, wrong top-level key,
  missing reader/mapper, bad class path, both interval and cron,
  neither, non-dotted class), Python-module loader (all four export
  styles + error paths), hybrid merge, config fallback, and client
  resolution (skip/eager/unknown/missing-section).
- 22 new tests in `tests/unit/schedule/test_cli_schedule.py` covering
  every subcommand via `gnat.cli.main.main()` directly, so the tests
  exercise the real argparse plumbing. Both table and JSON output
  formats verified per subcommand.
- Full unit suite: 4,678 passed, 198 skipped — +57 new tests,
  zero regressions.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 9: Certificate Transparency + DFIR + Bug Bounty

Six connectors closing out Phase 2 with cert-transparency log search,
endpoint DFIR, and bug-bounty / VDP platforms. Platform count:
152 → 158. All six are read-only via the CRUD contract; write
operations (where applicable) are exposed as named domain helpers.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `crtsh/` — `CrtShClient` for the public crt.sh Certificate
  Transparency search aggregator (operated by Sectigo). No
  authentication. The first connector to emit STIX 2.1
  `x509-certificate` SCOs natively. Domain helpers: `search_domain`
  (with `include_subdomains` for prefix-`%.` expansion),
  `get_certificate`.
- `google_ct/` — `GoogleCTClient` for the RFC 6962 read endpoints
  exposed by Google's Argon / Xenon CT logs. Per-log path config so
  one client can switch between logs without re-instantiation.
  Domain helpers: `get_sth`, `get_entries`, `get_roots`,
  `get_proof_by_hash`. Custom `x-google-ct-sth` SCO for the signed
  tree head.
- `velociraptor/` — `VelociraptorClient` for the open-source
  Velociraptor DFIR server. `TRUST_LEVEL = trusted_internal`.
  Supports either Bearer token (proxied deployments) or mTLS
  cert/key (the OSS server's default). Dispatches across clients
  (agents), hunts, flows, and the artifact catalog. Custom
  `x-velociraptor-{client,hunt,artifact}` SCOs. Domain helpers:
  `list_clients`, `get_client`, `list_hunts`, `get_hunt`,
  `list_flows`, `list_artifacts`, `run_vql` (arbitrary VQL
  execution), `run_hunt` (artifact-driven hunt creation).
- `magnet_axiom/` — `MagnetAxiomClient` for Magnet AXIOM Cyber
  remote forensic acquisition. `X-API-Key` header auth. `COST_UNIT
  = 2` (collections are expensive). `TRUST_LEVEL = trusted_internal`.
  Dispatches across cases, evidence sources, extracted artifacts,
  agents, collections, and examiner accounts. Custom `x-axiom-agent`
  and `x-axiom-collection` SCOs. Domain helpers: `list_cases`,
  `get_case`, `list_evidence`, `list_artifacts`, `list_agents`,
  `list_collections`, `list_users`, `create_case`,
  `start_collection`.
- `hackerone/` — `HackerOneClient` for HackerOne bug bounty / VDP /
  pentest-as-a-service. HTTP Basic (api_username + api_token).
  Dispatches across reports, programs (all + mine), structured
  scopes (assets), and the accepted weakness taxonomy. Custom
  `x-h1-program` and `x-h1-scope` SCOs; weaknesses map to STIX
  `vulnerability`. Domain helpers: `list_reports`, `get_report`,
  `list_programs`, `get_program`, `list_weaknesses`,
  `list_structured_scopes`, `add_report_comment`,
  `change_report_state`.
- `bugcrowd/` — `BugcrowdClient` for Bugcrowd managed bug bounty /
  pentest. `Authorization: Token <token>` header. Dispatches across
  submissions, programs, in-scope targets, bounty rewards, managed
  pentest reports, and tenant organizations. Custom
  `x-bugcrowd-{program,target,reward,organization,report}` SCOs.
  Domain helpers: `list_submissions`, `get_submission`,
  `list_programs`, `list_targets`, `list_rewards`,
  `list_pentest_reports`, `list_organizations`,
  `add_submission_comment`, `change_submission_state` (uses HTTP
  PATCH on the resource, not POST).

**Architectural notes**
- Project Honey Pot (Wave 8) was the first connector to bypass HTTP
  in favor of socket-based DNS lookups. Wave 9's crt.sh and
  google_ct are the first connectors to emit STIX `x509-certificate`
  SCOs as their primary output type, which means the test contract
  helper now needs to accept that type alongside the existing
  observable / SDO checks. (`_assert_stix_contract` already accepts
  any STIX type that has a `--<uuid>` id, so no helper changes were
  needed.)
- Velociraptor is the first GNAT connector to support a dual-auth
  pattern out of the box: either an `api_token` for proxied HTTP
  deployments or `cert_path` + `key_path` for mTLS, which is the
  Velociraptor server's default after running its config generator.
- Bugcrowd's `change_submission_state` is the first GNAT domain
  helper to use HTTP PATCH (rather than POST) to mutate state on a
  resource — using the existing `BaseClient.patch` method.

**Tests**
- 88 new tests across `TestCrtShClient` (9), `TestGoogleCTClient`
  (13), `TestVelociraptorClient` (17), `TestMagnetAxiomClient` (16),
  `TestHackerOneClient` (16), `TestBugcrowdClient` (15), plus two
  Phase 2 Wave 9 integrity tests for the registry and config
  sections. Connector suite: 2408 tests passing (was 2320).
- Ruff clean across all new files.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 8: Real-time OSINT + Fraud / Bot Defense

Six connectors covering the real-time event intelligence and fraud /
bot-defense tiers. Platform count: 143 → 152 (Wave 8 adds the fifteenth
through twentieth Phase 2 connectors; running count includes earlier
gap-fills). All six are read-only via the CRUD contract.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `dataminr/` — `DataminrClient` for Dataminr Pulse real-time event
  intelligence. OAuth2 client credentials at `/auth/2/token`; uses the
  vendor's custom `Authorization: Dmauth <token>` scheme (not Bearer).
  Dispatches across alerts, watchlists, watchlist-scoped alerts, and
  related-alert traversal. Custom `x-dataminr-list` SCO for watchlist
  taxonomy. Domain helpers: `list_alerts`, `get_alert`,
  `list_watchlists`, `list_list_alerts`, `list_related_alerts`.
- `factal/` — `FactalClient` for Factal verified breaking-news
  intelligence. Bearer token. Dispatches across events, topics, and
  places. Custom `x-factal-topic` SCO; places are mapped to STIX
  `identity` objects with `x_factal_place` extension. Domain helpers:
  `list_events`, `get_event`, `list_topics`, `list_places`.
- `samdesk/` — `SamdeskClient` for Samdesk global crisis detection.
  `X-Api-Key` header auth. Dispatches across events, categories, and
  topics. Custom `x-samdesk-category` and `x-samdesk-topic` SCOs.
  Domain helpers: `list_events`, `get_event`, `list_categories`,
  `list_topics`.
- `human_security/` — `HumanSecurityClient` for HUMAN Security
  (formerly White Ops) bot-defense, account-takeover, and
  credential-stuffing telemetry. OAuth2 client credentials at
  `/oauth/token`. `TRUST_LEVEL = trusted_internal`. Dispatches across
  bot-detections, ATO events, credential-stuffing events, threats,
  and integrations. Emits `indicator` for threat IOCs and
  `observed-data` envelopes wrapping `ipv4-addr` + `user-account` refs
  for events. Custom `x-human-integration` SCO. Domain helpers:
  `list_bot_detections`, `list_account_takeover_events`,
  `list_credential_stuffing`, `list_threats`, `list_integrations`.
- `abuseipdb/` — `AbuseIPDBClient` for AbuseIPDB community IP
  reputation. Custom `Key` header auth. Dispatches across single-IP
  reputation, CIDR-block reputation, the high-confidence blacklist,
  and historical reports. Threshold-based labeling
  (`abuseConfidenceScore >= 50` → `malicious-activity`). Domain
  helpers: `check_ip`, `check_block`, `get_blacklist`, `get_reports`,
  and a `submit_report` write-side helper (CRUD upsert remains
  read-only). Module-level `_unwrap_abuseipdb()` strips the
  `{"data": ...}` envelope.
- `project_honey_pot/` — `ProjectHoneyPotClient` for the Project
  Honey Pot http:BL DNS reputation feed. The first GNAT connector to
  use a pure DNS-based protocol — overrides the HTTP CRUD methods to
  issue `socket.gethostbyname` lookups against
  `<api_key>.<reversed-ip>.dnsbl.httpbl.org`, then parses the
  `127.X.Y.Z` response into days-since-activity / threat-score /
  visitor-type-bitfield. NXDOMAIN is handled cleanly as "not listed".
  Domain helpers: `check_ip`, `check_ips`. `list_objects` requires an
  explicit `ips` filter since http:BL has no native list endpoint.

**Architectural notes**
- Dataminr authenticates with the vendor's idiosyncratic
  `Authorization: Dmauth <token>` scheme — the first connector to
  diverge from Basic / Bearer / API key.
- Project Honey Pot is the first connector to skip the HTTP transport
  entirely and use the `socket` module directly, while still inheriting
  from `BaseClient` and `ConnectorMixin` for registry and STIX
  contract compatibility.
- AbuseIPDB demonstrates the "domain helper for write operations"
  pattern more cleanly than prior waves: `submit_report` is a domain
  helper, while `upsert_object` raises `GNATClientError` to keep the
  CRUD contract read-only.
- Fixed a recurrence of the conditional-expression precedence trap in
  `dataminr/client.py` `to_stix` (the `if/else` was accidentally
  gating the whole `or` chain when extracting the `alertType` and
  `source` names from nested dicts).

**Tests**
- 80 new tests across `TestDataminrClient` (13),
  `TestFactalClient` (14), `TestSamdeskClient` (13),
  `TestHumanSecurityClient` (15), `TestAbuseIPDBClient` (14),
  `TestProjectHoneyPotClient` (14), plus two Phase 2 Wave 8 integrity
  tests for the registry and config sections. The Project Honey Pot
  tests stub `socket.gethostbyname` via monkeypatch to exercise both
  listed and NXDOMAIN response paths without touching the network.
- Ruff clean across all new files.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 7: Insider Risk / UEBA

Five connectors covering the insider-risk and user/entity behavior
analytics tier. Platform count: 138 → 143. All five are
`trusted_internal` and read-only.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `code42/` — `Code42Client` for Code42 Incydr (file-exfiltration
  insider risk). OAuth2 client-credentials flow via the v1/oauth
  endpoint (Basic auth → Bearer). Dispatches across file-events
  (v2 search), alerts, cases, users, user-risk-profiles. Custom
  `x-code42-risk-profile` SCO for per-user risk posture. Emits
  `observed-data` envelopes wrapping synthetic `user-account` +
  `file` refs. Domain helpers: `search_file_events`, `list_alerts`,
  `list_cases`, `get_case`, `list_users`, `list_user_risk_profiles`.
- `dtex/` — `DTEXClient` for DTEX InTERCEPT behavioral insider
  threat. Bearer auth. Dispatches across alerts, incidents,
  activities, users, policies, risk-factors. Custom `x-dtex-policy`
  and `x-dtex-risk-factor` SCOs. Domain helpers: `list_alerts`,
  `list_incidents`, `list_activities`, `list_users`, `list_policies`,
  `list_risk_factors`, `get_alert`.
- `gurucul/` — `GuruculClient` for the Gurucul UEBA platform.
  Bearer auth. Dispatches across incidents, anomalies, user/entity
  risk scores, models, cases. Custom `x-gurucul-entity` and
  `x-gurucul-model` SCOs. Domain helpers: `list_incidents`,
  `list_anomalies`, `list_user_risk_scores`, `list_entity_risk_scores`,
  `list_models`, `list_cases`, `get_incident`.
- `exabeam/` — `ExabeamClient` for the Exabeam Security Operations
  Platform (cloud UEBA). OAuth2 client-credentials via /auth/v1/token.
  Dispatches across incidents, sessions (Smart Timeline unit),
  alerts, cases, notable-assets, users. Domain helpers:
  `list_incidents`, `list_sessions`, `list_alerts`, `list_cases`,
  `list_notable_assets`, `list_users`, `get_incident`.
- `securonix/` — `SecuronixClient` for cloud-native SIEM / UEBA.
  Username / password exchanged for a session token via
  `/ws/token/generate` — the token is returned as a bare string
  which this connector handles. Dispatches across incidents,
  violations, threats, Spotter search, users, policies. Custom
  `x-securonix-policy` SCO. Domain helpers: `list_incidents`,
  `get_incident`, `list_violations`, `list_threats`, `search_spotter`,
  `list_users`, `list_policies`.

**Architectural notes**
- Code42 had the same Python conditional-expression precedence bug
  Entra ID had (the `if/else` accidentally gating the whole `or`
  chain in `to_stix`). Fixed with an explicit stepwise lookup.
- Securonix is the first connector to authenticate via
  username/password → session token (the token is then sent as
  a ``token`` header rather than as a standard Bearer).

**Tests**
- 71 new tests across `TestCode42Client` (14),
  `TestDTEXClient` (14), `TestGuruculClient` (14),
  `TestExabeamClient` (15), `TestSecuronixClient` (16) plus two
  Phase 2 Wave 7 integrity tests. Full unit suite: 2626 tests
  passing, zero regressions.
- Ruff clean across all new files.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 6: Advanced Email Security

Two advanced email security connectors completing the email-gateway
tier (Proofpoint TAP was already present; Abnormal Security ships in
Phase 1 Wave 3b). Platform count: 136 → 138. Both connectors are
`trusted_internal` and read-only.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `mimecast/` — `MimecastClient` for the Mimecast API 2.0. OAuth2
  client-credentials flow against ``/oauth/token``. Same pattern as
  Phase 2 Wave 5 Entra ID / Ping Identity — uses a local
  `urllib3.PoolManager` for the token exchange before stamping the
  Bearer token. Dispatches across six endpoint families via
  `filters["kind"]`: `messages` (message-finder search), `url_logs`
  (URL Protect), `attachment_logs` (Attachment Protect sandbox),
  `impersonation_logs` (BEC / CEO fraud), `threat_intel`
  (Mimecast TI feed), `audit_events`. Domain helpers:
  `search_messages`, `list_url_protect_logs`,
  `list_attachment_protect_logs`, `list_impersonation_logs`,
  `get_threat_intel_feed`, `list_users`, `list_groups`,
  `list_audit_events`. Module-level `_extract_mimecast_items()`
  walks the nested `{"data": [{"messages": [...]}]}` envelope.
- `ironscales/` — `IRONSCALESClient` for the IRONSCALES AI email
  security platform. Per-company API key with an additional
  `X-Company-Id` tenant-routing header — both required. Company-
  scoped URL construction via `_company_path()` helper. Dispatches
  across incidents, reported emails, affected mailboxes, mailboxes,
  mitigation actions, classifications, and federation signatures
  (community intel). Signatures map to STIX `indicator` with typed
  patterns (URL, domain, IP, SHA-256). Custom
  `x-ironscales-classification` SCO. Domain helpers:
  `list_incidents`, `get_incident`, `list_affected_mailboxes`,
  `list_reported_emails`, `list_mailboxes`, `list_mitigation_actions`,
  `list_classifications`, `list_federation_signatures`.

**Tests**
- 35 new tests across `TestMimecastClient` (15) and
  `TestIRONSCALESClient` (18) plus two Phase 2 Wave 6 integrity
  tests. Full unit suite: 2555 tests passing, zero regressions.
- Ruff clean across all new files.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 5: Identity Providers (IdP)

Three IdP connectors filling the biggest remaining category gap after
Phase 1 Wave 3b introduced the ITDR tier. ITDR (Silverfort, Semperis)
watches identity at runtime; IdP (Okta, Entra ID, Ping) is the directory
itself. Platform count: 133 → 136. All three are `trusted_internal`
and read-only.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `okta/` — `OktaClient` for Okta Identity Cloud. Proprietary
  `Authorization: SSWS <api_token>` header. Dispatches across
  `/api/v1/users`, `/groups`, `/apps`, `/logs`, `/policies`, `/factors`.
  Custom `x-okta-app` SCO for registered applications. Emits
  `user-account`, `identity` (groups), `observed-data` (system-log
  events with synthetic user + source-ip refs), plus `x-okta-app`.
  Domain helpers: `list_users`, `get_user`, `list_groups`,
  `list_group_members`, `list_apps`, `list_app_users`,
  `list_system_log_events`, `list_policies`, `list_factors`.
- `entra_id/` — `EntraIDClient` for Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
  via Microsoft Graph v1.0. OAuth2 client-credentials flow against
  `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token` with
  scope `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`. Uses an ad-hoc
  `urllib3.PoolManager` for the token endpoint since it lives on a
  different host. Three dispatched `observed-data` kinds via
  `filters["kind"]`: `sign_ins`, `directory_audits`, `risky_users`
  (the last being Identity Protection ITDR signals). Custom
  `x-entra-application` SCO for service principals and
  `x-entra-ca-policy` for Conditional Access policies. Domain helpers:
  `list_users`, `list_groups`, `list_group_members`,
  `list_service_principals`, `list_sign_ins`, `list_directory_audits`,
  `list_risky_users`, `list_conditional_access_policies`,
  `list_organization`. Module-level `_extract_entra_value()` unwraps
  the OData `{"value": [...]}` envelope.
- `ping_identity/` — `PingIdentityClient` for PingOne. OAuth2
  client-credentials against a region-aware endpoint
  (`_AUTH_REGIONS` maps NA/EU/AP/CA to the right
  `auth.pingone.*` domain). Environment-scoped URLs via
  `_env_path()` helper. Dispatches across users, populations
  (PingOne's group-equivalent), applications, sign-on policies,
  activities, audit events. Custom `x-ping-application` SCO. Domain
  helpers: `list_users`, `get_user`, `list_populations`,
  `list_applications`, `list_sign_on_policies`, `list_activities`,
  `list_audit_events`, `list_user_groups`. Module-level
  `_extract_ping_list()` handles the HAL-style `_embedded` envelope.

**Tests**
- 51 new tests across `TestOktaClient` (15), `TestEntraIDClient` (16),
  `TestPingIdentityClient` (18) plus two Phase 2 Wave 5 integrity
  tests. Full unit suite: 2520 tests passing, zero regressions.
- One bug caught during integration: Entra ID's `to_stix` had a
  Python precedence bug in the `user_id` extraction where the
  conditional-expression `if/else` was accidentally gating the whole
  `or` chain. Fixed by rewriting as an explicit two-step lookup.

**Architectural notes**
- All three connectors introduce vendor-specific custom SCOs for
  enterprise applications (`x-okta-app`, `x-entra-application`,
  `x-ping-application`). Continues the pattern established in Phase 1
  Wave 3b (`x-cryptocurrency-wallet` on TRM Labs) and Phase 2 Wave 2
  (`x-huntress-agent`).
- Entra ID and Ping Identity are the first Phase 2 connectors to issue
  OAuth2 token requests against a hostname **other than** the main
  API host. Both use a local `urllib3.PoolManager` for the token
  exchange rather than the standard `self.post()` path.

### Added — Connector Gap Fills + Stub Rescues

Filled the audit-identified domain-helper gaps in 9 existing connectors
and rescued the 2 audit-flagged "framework stub" connectors. No new
connector entries; this is **breadth work** on existing connectors.
After this commit, every connector in the registry has at least 4
domain helpers beyond the 7-method `ConnectorMixin` contract.

**Gap fills (9 existing connectors)**

- `threatconnect/client.py` — added 7 helpers exposing the v3 TQL
  filter language: `search_indicators`, `search_groups`, `list_owners`,
  `get_indicator`, `get_group`, `list_tags`, `get_associations`. Plus a
  module-level `_extract_tc_data()` helper for the v3 envelope shape.
- `proofpoint/client.py` — split the catch-all `/v2/siem/all` into
  typed event helpers: `list_messages_delivered`,
  `list_messages_blocked`, `list_clicks_permitted`,
  `list_clicks_blocked`, `list_issues`, `get_forensics`,
  `list_top_clickers`, `decode_url`. Removes the audit's biggest
  email-event-categorization gap.
- `shadowserver/client.py` — added typed query helpers replacing the
  generic dispatch: `query_ip`, `query_asn`, `query_cve`,
  `query_malware`, `query_botnet`, `list_report_types`, `query_report`.
- `jira/client.py` — added 8 issue / project / workflow helpers:
  `search_jql`, `get_issue`, `create_issue`, `update_issue`,
  `transition_issue`, `list_transitions`, `list_projects`,
  `get_project`, `list_issue_comments`. Builds ADF descriptions via
  the existing `_build_adf_paragraph` helper.
- `servicenow/client.py` — added 8 incident / change / CMDB helpers:
  `list_incidents`, `get_incident`, `create_incident`,
  `list_change_requests`, `create_change_request`, `query_table`
  (generic), `get_cmdb_ci`, `list_cmdb_ci_by_name`. Module-level
  `_extract_sn_record()` and `_extract_sn_records()` strip the
  ServiceNow Table API `result` envelope.
- `qualys/client.py` — added 5 helpers for the asset / scan / report
  flow: `list_assets`, `list_asset_groups`, `list_scans`,
  `launch_scan`, `list_reports`. All correctly walk the deep XML→JSON
  envelope shape Qualys returns.
- `yeti/client.py` — added 9 helpers for the relationship-graph
  workflow: `search_observables`, `search_entities`, `get_observable`,
  `get_entity`, `get_neighbors` (the core graph-traversal endpoint),
  `list_indicators`, `list_tags`, `link_objects`. Module-level
  `_extract_yeti_list()` for the v2 envelope shape.
- `fortisiem/client.py` — added 6 helpers beyond `fetch_incidents`:
  `get_incident`, `update_incident`, `list_monitored_devices`,
  `list_dashboards`, `list_rules`, `query_events`.
- `pulsedive/client.py` — added 7 helpers beyond `enrich`:
  `get_indicator`, `get_threat`, `search_indicators`, `list_threats`,
  `list_feeds`, `get_feed`, `analyze`. Module-level
  `_extract_pd_list()` helper.

**Stub rescues (2 connectors)**

- `socradar/client.py` — graduated from "framework stubs only" to a
  real connector. Added 9 domain helpers across the SOCRadar
  capability suite: `search_iocs`, `list_threat_actors`,
  `get_threat_actor`, `list_malware_families`, `get_malware`,
  `list_dark_web_findings`, `list_brand_alerts`,
  `list_attack_surface_alerts`, `list_industry_threats`. Module-level
  `_extract_socradar_list()` helper.
- `stellarcyber/client.py` — graduated from "framework stubs only" to
  a real Open XDR connector. Added 8 domain helpers: `list_alerts`,
  `get_alert`, `list_assets`, `list_cases`, `get_case`, `search_logs`,
  `list_threat_intel`, `list_tenants`. Module-level `_extract_sc_list()`
  helper.

**Tests**
- 64 new tests across 11 new `TestXxxGapFills` classes verifying every
  new domain helper hits the right HTTP path and parses the response
  envelope correctly.
- Full unit suite: 2469 tests passing, zero regressions.
- Ruff clean across all touched files.

**Coverage shift (per the audit grades)**
- threatconnect: **Minimal → Complete** (zero → 7 helpers)
- proofpoint: **Minimal → Complete** (zero → 8 helpers)
- shadowserver: **Minimal → Complete** (zero → 7 helpers)
- jira: **Minimal → Complete** (2 → 10 helpers)

- yeti: **Minimal → Complete** (1 → 10 helpers)
- fortisiem: **Minimal → Complete** (1 → 7 helpers)
- pulsedive: **Minimal → Complete** (1 → 8 helpers)
- socradar: **Stub → Complete** (zero → 9 helpers)
- stellarcyber: **Stub → Complete** (zero → 8 helpers)

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 4: Additional TI Vendor Feeds

Five more commercial / public threat intelligence vendor feeds from the
2026 audit's "additional TI" category. These complement the tier-1
platforms already in GNAT (ThreatQ, Mandiant, Recorded Future, etc.)
with vendor-specific reputation and APT telemetry from the major AV
makers and Cisco. Platform count: 128 → 133.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `talos/` — `TalosClient` for Cisco Talos public reputation lookups.
  No auth required; sets a `User-Agent` header because Talos rejects
  bot-like clients. IP / domain lookups via `/sb_api/query_lookup`;
  advisories via `/feeds/advisory.xml`. Reputation string mapped to
  STIX `labels` (``malicious-activity``/``benign``). Domain helpers:
  `ip_reputation`, `domain_reputation`, `get_advisories`.
- `fortiguard/` — `FortiGuardClient`. Optional Bearer auth (commercial
  IOC service only); public outbreak alerts + IP/URL reputation +
  virus encyclopedia work without a key. Dispatches across `/api/v1/iocs`,
  `/outbreak-alerts`, `/ip/{ip}`, `/url`, `/encyclopedia/virus`.
  `list_iocs` raises `GNATClientError` if called without an api_key
  since the IOC service is commercial. Domain helpers:
  `list_outbreak_alerts`, `list_iocs`, `ip_reputation`,
  `url_reputation`, `get_outbreak_alert`.
- `kaspersky_opentip/` — `KasperskyOpenTIPClient`. Optional `x-api-key`
  header. Dispatches across `/search/ip`, `/search/domain`,
  `/search/url`, `/search/hash`. Heuristic IOC-type guessing via
  `_guess_ioc_type()`. Kaspersky's "Zone" field (Red/Orange/Green)
  mapped to STIX labels. Domain helpers: `lookup_ip`, `lookup_domain`,
  `lookup_url`, `lookup_hash`.
- `eset_ti/` — `ESETThreatIntelClient`. Bearer token. Dispatches
  across `/api/v1/iocs`, `/reports`, `/samples`, `/yara`, `/botnet`.
  YARA rules get a custom `[x-eset-yara:rule = ...]` pattern. Domain
  helpers: `list_iocs`, `list_reports`, `list_samples`, `list_yara`,
  `list_botnet`, `get_report`, `get_sample`.
- `bitdefender_iz/` — `BitdefenderIntelliZoneClient`. `X-API-Key`
  header. Dispatches across `/api/v1/iocs`, `/reports`,
  `/malware/families`, `/apt/groups`, `/samples/{sha256}`. APT groups
  map to STIX `threat-actor` with `aliases` preserved. Domain helpers:
  `list_iocs`, `list_reports`, `list_malware_families`,
  `list_apt_groups`, `get_report`, `get_sample`.

**Tests**
- 59 new tests across `TestTalosClient` (11),
  `TestFortiGuardClient` (12), `TestKasperskyOpenTIPClient` (12),
  `TestESETThreatIntelClient` (11), `TestBitdefenderIntelliZoneClient`
  (15) plus two Phase 2 Wave 4 integrity tests.
- Full unit suite: 2405 tests passing, zero regressions.
- Ruff clean across all new files.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 3: BAS / Security Validation

Six Breach-and-Attack-Simulation / continuous-security-validation
connectors covering the top-rated BAS vendors from the 2026 audit
(SafeBreach, AttackIQ, Cymulate, Picus Security, Pentera, XM Cyber).
This wave pairs naturally with Phase 2 Wave 1 sandboxes: sandboxes
tell you what malware does, BAS tells you whether your controls
actually stop it. Platform count: 122 → 128.

All six connectors are `trusted_internal` (customer's own security
validation telemetry) and read-only.

**Shared helper (`gnat/utils/stix_helpers.py`)**
- `bas_simulation_envelope(source_name, simulation_id, …)` — builds a
  STIX 2.1 `observed-data` envelope around a BAS simulation run with
  deterministic UUID-5 refs to synthetic `identity` SCOs for each
  target asset and synthetic `attack-pattern` SCOs for each MITRE
  ATT&CK technique. Every Phase 2 Wave 3 connector consumes this
  helper.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `safebreach/` — `SafeBreachClient`. Custom `x-apitoken` +
  `x-accountid` header pair. Dispatches across `/api/data/v1/tests`,
  `/tests/{id}/simulations`, `/findings`, `/config/v1/scenarios`,
  `/config/v1/attackers`. `_acct_path()` helper centralizes the
  account-scoped URL construction. Domain helpers: `list_tests`,
  `list_simulations`, `list_findings`, `list_attackers`, `get_test`.
- `attackiq/` — `AttackIQClient`. `Authorization: Token` header.
  Dispatches across `/api/v1/assessments`, `/scenarios`, `/results`,
  `/phases`, `/tests`. DRF-style pagination (`results` key). Domain
  helpers: `list_assessments`, `list_results`, `list_scenarios`,
  `get_assessment`.
- `cymulate/` — `CymulateClient`. `x-token` header. Dispatches across
  `/v1/assessments`, `/technical-findings`, `/templates`,
  `/simulations`. Templates map to `attack-pattern`. Domain helpers:
  `list_assessments`, `list_findings`, `list_templates`,
  `list_simulations`, `get_assessment`.
- `picus/` — `PicusClient`. Refresh token exchanged for an access
  token on first request (`POST /v1/refresh-token`). Dispatches across
  `/v1/attacks`, `/simulations`, `/results`, `/threat-library`. Domain
  helpers: `list_attacks`, `list_simulations`, `list_results`,
  `list_threat_library`, `get_simulation`, `get_attack`.
- `pentera/` — `PenteraClient`. Bearer JWT auth (tenant-issued).
  Dispatches across `/api/v1/tasks`, `/findings`, `/assets`,
  `/techniques`, `/achievements`. Findings map to STIX `vulnerability`
  with CVE external refs; tasks/assets/achievements map to
  `observed-data` envelopes. Domain helpers: `list_tasks`,
  `list_findings`, `list_assets`, `list_achievements`,
  `list_techniques`, `get_task`, `get_finding`.
- `xm_cyber/` — `XMCyberClient`. API key exchanged for a session
  Bearer via `POST /api/v2/auth/login`. Dispatches across
  `/api/v2/entities`, `/attack-paths`, `/critical-assets`,
  `/techniques`. Entities and critical assets both map to STIX
  `identity` (with `_xm_identity_class` heuristic that maps
  user/host/cloud to STIX identity_class values). Domain helpers:
  `list_entities`, `list_critical_assets`, `list_attack_paths`,
  `list_techniques`, `get_entity`, `get_attack_path`.

**Tests**
- 76 new tests across six new `TestXxxClient` classes plus two
  Phase 2 Wave 3 integrity tests plus 4 new
  `TestBasSimulationEnvelope` tests for the shared helper.
- Full unit suite: 2346 tests passing, zero regressions.
- Ruff clean across all new files.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 2: MDR Platforms

Three Managed Detection & Response connectors covering the top-rated
MDR vendors from the 2026 audit. This wave fills the gap between
platform-level EDR (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc., already in GNAT) and
the managed-service delivery layer — the tier where analyst-generated
tickets, investigations, and confirmed detections live. Platform count:
119 → 122.

All three connectors are `trusted_internal` (customer's own MDR
telemetry) and read-only.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `huntress/` — `HuntressClient` for Huntress Managed EDR / ITDR.
  HTTP Basic auth with `api_key_id` as username + `api_secret` as
  password (reuses `BaseClient._basic_auth`). Endpoints: `/v1/account`,
  `/v1/organizations`, `/v1/agents`, `/v1/incident_reports`,
  `/v1/reports`, `/v1/signals`. Incident reports map to
  `observed-data` envelopes with refs to the affected `identity`
  (organization), custom `x-huntress-agent` SCO for the deployed
  agent, and any `ipv4-addr` observables from `remote_ip`. Domain
  helpers: `list_organizations`, `list_agents`, `list_incidents`,
  `get_incident`. `_unwrap_huntress` helper strips Huntress's
  single-key envelopes (e.g. `{"organization": {...}}`).
- `arctic_wolf/` — `ArcticWolfClient` for Arctic Wolf MDR. Bearer
  token auth with an optional `X-Arctic-Wolf-Customer` header for
  multi-tenant MSSP deployments. Dispatches across `/v1/tickets`,
  `/v1/tickets/{id}/comments`, `/v1/investigations`, `/v1/customer`.
  Tickets and investigations both map to `observed-data` envelopes
  with `filters["kind"]` selecting the endpoint. Domain helpers:
  `list_tickets`, `list_investigations`, `get_ticket`,
  `get_ticket_comments`, `get_customer`.
- `red_canary/` — `RedCanaryClient` for Red Canary MDR. `X-Api-Key`
  header auth, JSON:API response shape (`{"data": ...}`) unwrapped by
  `_unwrap_rc`. Endpoints: `/openapi/v3/detections`, `/endpoints`,
  `/events`, `/organization`. Detections map to `observed-data`
  envelopes with refs to the affected endpoint as `identity` and any
  source `ipv4-addr`. Attribute nesting (`attributes.severity` etc.)
  is handled inline in `to_stix`. Domain helpers: `list_detections`,
  `get_detection`, `list_endpoints`, `get_endpoint`, `list_events`.

**Tests**
- 43 new tests across `TestHuntressClient` (15),
  `TestArcticWolfClient` (14), `TestRedCanaryClient` (14) plus two
  Phase 2 Wave 2 integrity tests. Full unit suite: 2270 tests
  passing, zero regressions. Ruff clean across all new files.

**Architectural notes**
- All three MDR connectors introduce a custom SCO on the Huntress side
  (`x-huntress-agent`) for the deployed agent record. This mirrors the
  pattern Phase 1 Wave 3b established with `x-cryptocurrency-wallet`
  on TRM Labs — custom STIX observable types are acceptable when the
  platform's native entity doesn't have a natural STIX analog.

### Added — Phase 2 Wave 1: Malware Sandboxes

Five dynamic-malware-analysis connectors closing the single biggest
remaining coverage gap from the 2026 audit. Up to this point GNAT had
zero sandbox connectors — every IOC came from static-analysis / reputation
sources. Phase 2 Wave 1 introduces the full sandbox tier at once so
subsequent workflows (ransomware triage, phishing chain analysis,
malware family attribution) have behavioral telemetry to consume.
Platform count: 114 → 119.

**Shared helper (`gnat/utils/stix_helpers.py`)**
- `sandbox_report_envelope(source_name, analysis_id, …)` — builds a
  STIX 2.1 `observed-data` envelope around a sandbox behavioral report
  with deterministic UUID-5 refs to synthetic `file`/`url`/`process`/
  `ipv4-addr`/`domain-name`/`url` observables. Every Phase 2 Wave 1
  connector consumes this helper so all five produce consistent
  envelope shapes.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `joe_sandbox/` — `JoeSandboxClient` for Joe Sandbox Cloud. Joe's
  "apikey as POST form field" convention is wrapped in an
  `_authed_form()` helper. COST_UNIT=5 to reflect submission expense.
  Domain helpers: `submit_file`, `submit_url`, `get_submission`,
  `get_analysis`, `get_iocs`, `iocs_to_indicators`. STIX emits
  `observed-data` (full analysis), `malware` (family attribution from
  detection tags), and `indicator` (extracted IOCs).
- `any_run/` — `AnyRunClient` for ANY.RUN interactive sandbox.
  `Authorization: API-Key <key>` header. Domain helpers: `submit_file`,
  `submit_url`, `get_analysis`, `list_environments`. Maps ANY.RUN's
  nested `mainObject` + `network` structure to sandbox envelopes.
- `hybrid_analysis/` — `HybridAnalysisClient` for Hybrid Analysis /
  Falcon Sandbox. Requires both `api-key` header **and** a non-empty
  `User-Agent` (defaults to `"Falcon Sandbox"`); the connector rejects
  missing User-Agent at construction time. Domain helpers:
  `submit_file`, `submit_url`, `get_report_summary`, `hash_lookup`,
  `search_hash`. Maps `threat_level_human` to STIX `malware_types`.
- `vmray/` — `VMRayClient` for VMRay Cloud. `Authorization: api_key
  <key>` header. Unwraps VMRay's `{"data": ..., "result": "ok"}`
  envelope at the HTTP boundary via `_unwrap_vmray` so downstream
  mappers don't think about it. Domain helpers: `submit_file`,
  `submit_url`, `get_sample`, `get_analysis`, `get_submission`,
  `get_summary_v2` (the rich v2 behavioral summary format).
- `intezer/` — `IntezerClient` for Intezer Analyze. POSTs to
  `/get-access-token` on first request and caches the returned JWT as
  a Bearer token. Unique "binary DNA" code-reuse attribution → STIX
  `malware` with `x_intezer.code_reuse_pct`. Domain helpers:
  `analyze_file`, `analyze_hash`, `get_analysis`, `get_sub_analyses`,
  `get_iocs`, `get_family`, `get_file_analysis`.

**Architectural notes**
- All five sandboxes raise `GNATClientError` from
  `upsert_object`/`delete_object` — submissions are *domain helpers*
  (`submit_file`, `submit_url`, `analyze_file`, `analyze_hash`), not
  STIX CRUD writes. This matches the read-only-CRUD convention
  established in Phase 1.
- COST_UNIT=5 on all five connectors to reflect the relative expense
  of submitting samples vs cheap lookups in other connectors.

**Tests**
- 66 new connector tests across `TestJoeSandboxClient` (14),
  `TestAnyRunClient` (12), `TestHybridAnalysisClient` (13),
  `TestVMRayClient` (13), `TestIntezerClient` (14) plus two Phase 2
  Wave 1 integrity tests.
- 5 new tests for `sandbox_report_envelope` in
  `tests/unit/test_stix_helpers.py` (basic file envelope, URL
  submission, deterministic ids, raw report embedding, empty
  artifacts).
- Full unit suite: 2047 tests passing, zero regressions.
- Ruff clean across all new files.

### Added — Phase 1 Wave 3b: Tier 1 Connector Expansion (Identity / Email / Finance)

Five more Tier 1 connectors completing Wave 3. Per the user's "Both" vote
on the ITDR vendor question, both Silverfort and Semperis ship
simultaneously. Abnormal Security and Cofense Intelligence fill the
advanced email / BEC gap. TRM Labs covers blockchain / cryptocurrency
threat intelligence. Platform count: 109 → 114.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `silverfort/` — `SilverfortClient` for the ITDR platform. OAuth2
  client-credentials auth exchanged at ``/api/v1/auth/token``, Bearer
  cached on ``_auth_headers``. `TRUST_LEVEL = "trusted_internal"` (the
  customer's own authentication telemetry). Emits `user-account`
  (humans + service accounts) and `observed-data` (auth events with
  synthetic user-account + ipv4-addr refs). Domain helpers:
  `list_users`, `list_service_accounts`, `list_auth_events`,
  `list_alerts`, `get_user_risk`.
- `semperis/` — `SemperisClient` for Directory Services Protector.
  Bearer-token auth, `TRUST_LEVEL = "trusted_internal"`. Endpoints:
  `/IoEs`, `/IoCs`, `/Security/Evaluators`, `/Tenants/Forest/Domains`,
  `/Security/Events`. IoE records map to STIX `indicator` with
  `anomalous-activity` label + `[x-semperis-ioe:evaluator = ...]`
  pattern; IoC records use `malicious-activity`. Security events map to
  `observed-data` wrapping a user-account ref for the actor. Domain
  helpers: `list_ioes`, `list_iocs`, `list_evaluators`,
  `list_forest_domains`, `list_security_events`.
- `abnormal/` — `AbnormalClient` for Abnormal Security (BEC / credential
  phishing / vendor impersonation). Bearer-token auth,
  `TRUST_LEVEL = "trusted_internal"`. Dispatches across `/threats`,
  `/cases`, `/vendor-cases`, `/abusemailbox/campaigns` via
  `filters["kind"]`. Each record maps to `observed-data` wrapping a
  deterministic `email-message` ref and a sender `identity` ref, with
  full `x_abnormal` context (attack_type, attack_vector, attack_strategy,
  judgement, impersonated_party, vendor_name, case_id, subject).
  Domain helpers: `list_threats`, `get_threat`, `get_threat_message`,
  `list_cases`, `list_vendor_cases`, `list_abusemailbox_campaigns`.
- `cofense_intel/` — `CofenseIntelClient` for Cofense Intelligence /
  ThreatHQ. HTTP Basic auth (reuses `BaseClient._basic_auth`). Dispatches
  across `/threat/search`, `/threat/{id}`, `/threat/updates`,
  `/malware/families`, `/threat/actors`. Emits `indicator` (IPs, domains,
  URLs, SHA-256 hashes — all tagged with `x_cofense.human_verified =
  True`), `malware`, `threat-actor`, and `report` STIX types. Domain
  helpers: `search_threats`, `get_threat`, `recent_threats`,
  `list_malware_families`, `list_actors`.
- `trm_labs/` — `TRMLabsClient` for blockchain / crypto intel. HTTP
  Basic auth with the API key as username (empty password). Endpoints:
  `POST /screening/addresses` (batch risk screen), `GET /entities/{id}`
  (attribution), `GET /addresses/{chain}/{address}` (full profile).
  STIX mapping: screening results → `indicator` with a custom
  `[x-cryptocurrency-wallet:value = ... AND ...:chain = ...]` pattern
  and `malicious-activity` label when risk_score >= 10; entities →
  `threat-actor`; address profiles → `observed-data` wrapping a
  synthetic `x-cryptocurrency-wallet` ref. Domain helpers:
  `screen_address`, `screen_addresses_batch`, `get_entity`,
  `get_address_profile`.

**Tests**
- 68 new tests across `TestSilverfortClient` (13),
  `TestSemperisClient` (14), `TestAbnormalClient` (13),
  `TestCofenseIntelClient` (14), `TestTRMLabsClient` (16) plus two
  Wave 3b integrity tests. Full suite: 1977 tests passing, zero
  regressions.

### Added — Phase 1 Wave 3a: Tier 1 Connector Expansion (Infrastructure Pivoting)

Three infrastructure-pivoting connectors addressing the biggest 2026 audit
gap outside of sandbox telemetry: passive DNS, historical WHOIS, and
pre-weaponization attack infrastructure. Platform count: 106 → 109.

Per the user's "Both" decision on the pDNS vendor question, **both**
SecurityTrails and DomainTools are wired in; Silent Push complements them
with future-attack infrastructure detection.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `securitytrails/` — `SecurityTrailsClient` wraps
  `https://api.securitytrails.com/v1/` with custom `APIKEY` header auth.
  Supports current DNS, subdomains, historical DNS by record type
  (a/aaaa/mx/ns/soa/txt), historical WHOIS, DSL domain/IP search, and
  reverse-IP. Emits `domain-name`, `ipv4-addr`, `observed-data` (pDNS
  history). Domain helpers: `domain_info`, `subdomains`,
  `historical_dns`, `historical_whois`, `search_domains`, `reverse_ip`.
- `domaintools/` — `DomainToolsClient` for the Iris API with
  query-parameter `api_username` + `api_key` auth. Endpoints: current
  WHOIS, WHOIS history, Iris pivoting, hosting history, reverse-IP,
  reputation. Emits `domain-name`, `ipv4-addr`, `observed-data`. Domain
  helpers: `whois`, `whois_history`, `iris_investigate`, `reverse_ip`,
  `hosting_history`, `reputation`.
- `silent_push/` — `SilentPushClient` with `X-API-KEY` header auth.
  Endpoints: domain/IPv4 enrich, passive DNS, IOC search, asset scan.
  Emits `indicator` (future-attack signals) and `observed-data` (pDNS).
  Domain helpers: `ipv4_enrich`, `domain_enrich`, `padns`, `search_iocs`,
  `scan_asset`. Risk scores ≥50 flagged with `malicious-activity` label.

**Tests**
- 43 new tests across three new `TestXxxClient` classes +
  `test_phase1_wave3a_registry_contains_new_connectors` and
  `test_phase1_wave3a_config_sections_exist`. Full suite: 1909 tests
  passing, zero regressions.

### Added — Phase 1 Wave 2: Tier 1 Connector Expansion

Three more Tier 1 connectors targeting the 2026 audit's "unique enterprise
telemetry" slot: Cloudflare edge intel, GitGuardian secret incidents, and
runZero CAASM inventory. All three have published OpenAPI specs and were
originally slated as codegen candidates; in practice hand-writing the
STIX mapping was faster than post-processing auto-generated stubs.
Platform count: 103 → 106.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `cloudflare_intel/` — `CloudflareIntelClient` wraps the
  `/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/intel/` endpoints (domain, IP, ASN,
  WHOIS, passive DNS, domain history). Bearer-token + `account_id`
  required. Emits STIX `indicator` (domain / ipv4), `infrastructure`
  (ASN), and `observed-data` (WHOIS / pDNS / history). Deterministic
  UUID-5 ids keyed on the queried observable. Domain helpers:
  `get_domain_intel`, `get_ip_intel`, `get_asn_intel`, `get_whois`,
  `get_passive_dns`, `get_domain_history`. Registered as
  `"cloudflare_intel"`.
- `gitguardian/` — `GitGuardianClient` for the v1 REST API. Lists and
  fetches secret incidents (`/v1/incidents/secrets`), sources, and
  members. Ad-hoc scanning exposed via `scan_content` (POST `/v1/scan`)
  and `scan_content_batch` (POST `/v1/multiscan`). Incidents map to
  STIX `observed-data` envelopes wrapping file + identity observables
  via `make_observed_data_envelope`, with full `x_gitguardian` context
  (incident id, secret type + family, status, severity, validity,
  assignee, repository, occurrences). Registered as `"gitguardian"`.
- `runzero/` — `RunZeroClient` for the CAASM platform. `TRUST_LEVEL =
  "trusted_internal"` since runZero data is the customer's own asset
  inventory. Bulk exports via `/api/v1.0/export/org/{assets,services,
  software,vulnerabilities}.json`, single-asset lookup via
  `/api/v1.0/org/assets/{id}`, plus `list_sites` and `list_tasks`
  domain helpers. STIX mapping: assets → `observed-data` with
  `ipv4-addr` / `mac-addr` / `software` refs; software records →
  `software` SCO; vulnerability records → `vulnerability` SDO with
  CVSS external refs. Registered as `"runzero"`.

**Config (`config/config.ini.example`)**
- New sections `[cloudflare_intel]`, `[gitguardian]`, `[runzero]` under
  a "Phase 1 Wave 2" banner.

**Registry (`gnat/clients/__init__.py`)**
- Added imports + `CLIENT_REGISTRY` entries + `__all__` entries for
  `CloudflareIntelClient`, `GitGuardianClient`, `RunZeroClient`.

**Tests**
- `tests/unit/connectors/test_connectors.py` — 49 new tests across
  three new `TestXxxClient` classes + two Wave 2 integrity tests
  (`test_phase1_wave2_registry_contains_new_connectors`,
  `test_phase1_wave2_config_sections_exist`). Full suite: 1866 tests
  passing, zero regressions.

### Added — Phase 1 Wave 1: Tier 1 Connector Expansion

Four new connectors closing the biggest gaps in GNAT's 2026 coverage audit
(malware-family attribution, MITRE ATT&CK framework, open-source supply chain,
exploit intelligence). All four are read-only feeds and bring the platform
count from 99 → 103. Built on the existing `BaseClient` + `ConnectorMixin`
pattern with shared STIX-mapping helpers extracted to
`gnat/utils/stix_helpers.py`.

**New connectors (`gnat/connectors/`)**
- `mitre_attack/` — `MitreAttackClient` wraps the public MITRE ATT&CK TAXII 2.1
  server at `https://attack-taxii.mitre.org/api/v21/`. Supports all three
  matrices (`enterprise-attack`, `mobile-attack`, `ics-attack`). Registered
  as `"mitre_attack"`. Domain helpers: `get_technique`, `get_group`,
  `get_software`, `list_tactics`, `list_techniques`, `list_groups`.
- `abusech/` — `AbuseChClient` unified feed connector covering URLhaus,
  MalwareBazaar, ThreatFox, Feodo Tracker, and SSL Blacklist. Single
  registry entry (`"abusech"`) with per-feed dispatch via
  `filters["feed"]` in `list_objects`, plus domain helpers
  `query_urlhaus_url`, `query_urlhaus_host`, `query_mb_hash`,
  `query_threatfox_ioc`, `get_feodo_blocklist`, `get_sslbl_blocklist`.
  Optional `Auth-Key` header for higher rate-limit tier. Emits STIX
  `indicator` objects with deterministic UUID-5 ids and per-feed
  `x_urlhaus`/`x_malwarebazaar`/`x_threatfox`/`x_feodotracker`/`x_sslbl`
  extensions.
- `osv/` — `OSVClient` for the open-source vulnerability database at
  `https://api.osv.dev`. Endpoints: `/v1/query`, `/v1/querybatch`,
  `/v1/vulns/{id}`. Domain helpers: `query_package`, `query_batch`,
  `get_vuln`. Emits STIX `vulnerability` objects via the shared
  `osv_to_stix_vulnerability()` helper.
- `vulncheck/` — `VulnCheckClient` for exploit intelligence at
  `https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/`. Supports all six indices
  (`vulncheck-kev`, `initial-access`, `exploits`, `canary-intelligence`,
  `mitre-cve`, `nist-nvd2`). Domain helpers: `get_kev`, `get_exploits`,
  `get_initial_access`, `list_indices`. Bearer-token auth.

**New TAXII reader (`gnat/ingest/sources/`)**
- `mitre_taxii_reader.py`: `MitreAttackTAXIIReader(TAXIICollectionReader)`
  auto-discovers the enterprise/mobile/ICS matrix collections and wraps
  every poll with a thread-safe token-bucket rate limiter matching
  MITRE's published 10 requests / 10 minutes / source IP limit. Module
  constants: `MITRE_TAXII_ROOT`, `MITRE_COLLECTION_IDS`.

**Shared STIX helpers (`gnat/utils/stix_helpers.py`)**
- `make_observed_data_envelope(first_observed, last_observed, …)` —
  builds STIX 2.1 `observed-data` SDOs with deterministic UUID-5 ids
  derived from source + observation window + object_refs. Consumed by
  all upcoming sandbox/identity/secret-scanning connectors.
- `osv_to_stix_vulnerability(osv_dict)` — converts OSV-schema vulnerability
  dicts to STIX 2.1 `vulnerability` objects. Handles CVE/GHSA/OSV id
  aliasing, CVSS severity → external references, affected package ranges
  → `x_osv_affected`, CWE IDs → `x_cwe_ids`.
- `cvss_to_external_reference(vector, score, version)` — builds STIX
  `external_references` entries for CVSS v2/v3/v4 vectors.
- `make_indicator_pattern(observable_type, value)` — centralized STIX
  pattern builder for ipv4-addr, ipv6-addr, domain-name, url, email-addr,
  file hashes (MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512), and x-cryptocurrency-wallet.
  Escapes single quotes.
- `x509_fingerprint_pattern(sha1, sha256, ja3, ja3s)` — STIX patterns for
  x509 fingerprints and TLS JA3/JA3S values; multiple fingerprints joined
  with `OR`.

**Config (`config/config.ini.example`)**
- New sections `[mitre_attack]`, `[abusech]`, `[osv]`, `[vulncheck]` at
  the end of the file under a "Phase 1 Wave 1" banner.

**Registry (`gnat/clients/__init__.py`)**
- Added imports + `CLIENT_REGISTRY` entries + `__all__` entries for
  `MitreAttackClient`, `AbuseChClient`, `OSVClient`, `VulnCheckClient`.

**Tests**
- `tests/unit/test_stix_helpers.py` — new file, 29 tests covering all
  core and Phase 1 Wave 1 helpers (deterministic ids, CVSS encoding,
  indicator pattern escaping, OSV → STIX conversion, JA3 patterns).
- `tests/unit/connectors/test_connectors.py` — 58 new tests across four
  new `TestXxxClient` classes + two Phase 1 Wave 1 integrity tests
  (`test_phase1_wave1_registry_contains_new_connectors`,
  `test_phase1_wave1_config_sections_exist`). Full suite: 1482 tests
  passing, zero regressions.

- `LLMClient` now accepts `backend="gemini"` — previously raised `NotImplementedError`; error message updated to list `gemini` as supported
- `ClaudeProvider` default model updated from `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` to `claude-sonnet-4-6`

**ResearchLibrary Solr integration**
- `ResearchLibrary.__init__` accepts optional `search_index` parameter (defaults to `NullSearchIndex`)
- `search()` dispatches to Solr when a `SolrSearchIndex` is attached, otherwise uses the existing in-memory scan

### Added — Federated Multi-GNAT Deployment

**Federation layer (`gnat/federation/`)**
- `FederationPeer` dataclass: models a remote GNAT peer with `peer_id`, `taxii_url`, `api_key`, `direction` (pull/push/both), `max_tlp` ceiling, optional `parent_peer_id` for hierarchical topologies, `workspace_filter` (explicit opt-in required — empty list = nothing shared), and sync state tracking (`last_sync_at`, `last_sync_status`)
- `PeerRegistry`: JSON-backed CRUD store for peer configuration (`~/.gnat/federation_peers.json`); `from_config()` parses `[federation.peer.*]` INI sections; `update_sync_status()` persists last sync result for incremental resumption

- `FederationScheduler`: creates one `FeedJob` per enabled peer; `start()` / `stop()` lifecycle; `trigger(peer_id)` for immediate one-off sync; `status()` returns per-peer sync state; persists `last_sync_at` to `PeerRegistry` via `on_success` callback for incremental resumption across restarts
- `FederationTopology`: `ancestors()`, `descendants()`, `parent()`, `children()`, `is_leaf()`, `is_root()`, cycle detection; `effective_max_tlp()` applies hierarchy defaults (AMBER up child→parent, GREEN down parent→child); `hierarchy_graph()` returns JSON topology for REST API

**GNATRemoteConnector (`gnat/connectors/gnat_remote/`)**
- `GNATRemoteConnector(BaseClient, ConnectorMixin)`: TAXII 2.1 client for remote GNAT instances; `authenticate()` sets Bearer token; `health_check()` pings discovery endpoint; `list_collections()`, `fetch_objects()`, `push_bundle()`, `list_objects()`, `get_object()`, `upsert_object()`, `delete_object()`; `to_stix()` / `from_stix()` are pass-throughs (both sides speak STIX 2.1 natively)

- `GET /api/federation/peers/{peer_id}/health` — ping remote TAXII discovery endpoint, return latency
- `POST /api/federation/peers/{peer_id}/sync` — trigger immediate sync (uses scheduler if running, falls back to direct sync)
- `GET /api/federation/topology` — mesh/hierarchy graph JSON (nodes, edges, hierarchy_edges)
- `create_app()` accepts `federation_registry`, `federation_scheduler`, `federation_sync_service` parameters

**Export (`gnat/export/delivery/targets.py`)**
- `TAXIIPushDelivery`: pushes STIX 2.1 bundles to a remote TAXII collection; wraps `HTTPDelivery` with TAXII media type headers

**Configuration**
- `config/config.ini.example`: added `[federation]`, `[federation.peer.acme-east]` (mesh), `[federation.peer.hospital-a]` and `[federation.peer.health-system-parent]` (hierarchical healthcare example)

**TAXII 2.1 Write Endpoints**
- `TAXIICollection.can_write = True` for TLP:AMBER and TLP:RED collections
- POST `/taxii2/{api-root}/collections/{id}/objects/`: push STIX 2.1 bundle; requires `WRITE_TAXII` permission; validates `type=bundle`; routes `report` objects to `store.ingest_stix()`; returns TAXII 2.1 status record (202)
- DELETE `/taxii2/{api-root}/collections/{id}/objects/{stix-id}`: soft-delete by STIX ID; tries `store.delete_by_stix_id()` first, falls back to scan+delete; returns 404 on not found
- `build_taxii_router()` gains optional `policy_engine=` parameter
- `_ingest_stix_objects()` and `_soft_delete_object()` helpers (testable independently)
- Updated module docstring to document all 8 endpoints (6 read + 2 write)

- `InvestigationStore.list()` now accepts `query: InvestigationQuery` with full filter → SQLAlchemy WHERE chain; `has_hypothesis`/`has_linked_report` post-filtered from JSON blob; legacy kwargs preserved for backward compatibility
- `InvestigationService.list()` accepts `InvestigationQuery` and passes it through

- `LineageTracker`: convenience wrapper with one `record_*` method per event type; `store=None` → silent no-op; exceptions never propagate to callers
- ADR-0038: Data Lineage Tracking — append-only event log; zero new runtime dependencies; optional deployment

**Analyst Metrics (`gnat/metrics/`)**
- `MetricType` enum: 9 types covering investigation lifecycle, enrichment effectiveness, report publishing, gap detection, false positives

### Added — Integration & CLI Hardening (Phase 4)

**CLI Subcommands (`gnat/cli/main.py`)**
- `gnat investigation` subcommand group: `list` (--status, --created-by, --tag, --text, --page, --page-size), `create` (--title, --created-by, --description, --tlp, --tags), `get <id>`, `transition <id> <status>` (--note, --author), `note <id>` (--content, --author), `link <id>` (--indicators, --reports)

- `gnat db` subcommand group: `upgrade`, `downgrade` (-1), `current`, `history`, `revision` (-m, --autogenerate), `stamp <revision>` — all delegated to `gnat.migrations.cli.run_db_command()`
- `gnat tui` now accepts `investigations` as a screen choice
- DB URL resolved from `GNAT_DB_URL` env var (default `sqlite:///gnat.db`) for investigation subcommand
- Graceful ImportError handling: missing SQLAlchemy → exit 1 with install hint; missing Alembic → exit 1 with install hint

**Data Lineage Wiring**

- `_load_investigations(status_filter, text)`: builds `InvestigationQuery`, populates DataTable
- `on_data_table_row_selected()`: shows detail pane with full investigation metadata
- `_apply_transition()`: calls `service.transition()`, refreshes table
- `GNATApp` gains `db_url=` parameter; F5 binding added; Investigations TabPane wired into `compose()`; `run()` and `_cmd_tui()` updated

**Tests**

---

### Added — Analysis Layer (Phase 0 + 1 + 2)

**`gnat.analysis` — Analyst-facing foundation**
- `gnat/analysis/tlp.py`: `TLPLevel` enum implementing TLP 2.0 (WHITE/CLEAR/GREEN/AMBER/AMBER+STRICT/RED) with STIX marking definition IDs, hex colours, rank ordering, and human-readable labels
- `gnat/analysis/confidence.py`: `ConfidenceScore` dataclass combining the NATO Admiralty Scale (source reliability A–F, information credibility 1–6) with a STIX 2.1 numeric confidence value (0–100); `ConfidenceLevel` convenience bands (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW); convenience factories `ConfidenceScore.high/medium/low()`

**`gnat.analysis.investigations` — Investigation lifecycle**
- `Investigation` dataclass: top-level analyst workspace with status state machine (OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → CLOSED), TLP classification, scope constraints, hypothesis tracking, analyst notes, tasks, and artifact linking
- `Hypothesis`, `AnalystNote`, `InvestigationTask`, `InvestigationScope` dataclasses
- `InvestigationStore`: SQLAlchemy-backed persistence (`sqlite:///:memory:` for tests, shared engine support); follows existing `WorkspaceStore` JSON-serialization pattern; zero-migration `create_all()` schema init
- `InvestigationService`: enforces state machine transitions, owns all mutation operations (create/get/list/delete/transition, add_note/task/hypothesis, link_indicators/observables/threat_actors, add_tags, summary)
- `InvestigationError` for invalid operations

**`gnat.reporting` — Intelligence product lifecycle**
- `Report` dataclass: structured intelligence product with five-state lifecycle (DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED), versioning with `parent_report_id` linkage, TLP classification, evidence binding, attribution, STIX export
- `Finding`, `EvidenceLink`, `Attribution`, `ReportSection`, `ChangelogEntry` dataclasses
- `ReportType` enum: INCIDENT_REPORT / THREAT_ACTOR_PROFILE / CAMPAIGN_ANALYSIS / DAILY_BRIEF / VULNERABILITY_ADVISORY / FINISHED_INTELLIGENCE
- `ReportStore`: SQLAlchemy-backed persistence with same zero-migration pattern as `InvestigationStore`
- `ReportService`: enforces lifecycle transitions; `publish()` auto-generates STIX bundle and sets `stix_report_ref`; `create_revision()` creates new draft from published version with incremented version
- `report_to_stix_bundle()`: serialises a `Report` to a STIX 2.1 bundle (report SDO + identity SDO + threat-actor SDO if attribution set + attributed-to relationship); TLP `object_marking_refs`; `x_gnat_*` extension fields
- Three report templates (YAML): `incident_report.yaml`, `threat_actor_profile.yaml`, `campaign_analysis.yaml`
- `[analysis]` and `[reporting]` optional dependency extras (both require `sqlalchemy>=2.0`)

**Architecture Decision Records**
- ADR-0031: Analysis Layer Architecture — layered consumer model; `WorkspaceStore` pattern for new tables; no new storage backend
- ADR-0032: STIX Custom Objects — `x-gnat-investigation` SDO schema; `investigates` custom relationship verb; standard `report` SDO for finished intelligence
- ADR-0033: Confidence Scoring Model — rationale for Admiralty Scale; STIX numeric confidence for interoperability; HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW bands aligned with ATT&CK convention
- ADR-0034: Report Lifecycle — five-state machine with reject path; immutability on PUBLISHED; versioning model; STIX bundle triggered on publish

**Tests**
- `tests/unit/analysis/test_confidence.py`: 16 tests covering TLP ordering, STIX marking IDs, confidence bands, Admiralty Scale, serialization roundtrips, bounds validation
- `tests/unit/analysis/test_investigations.py`: 24 tests covering model roundtrips, state machine valid/invalid transitions, full service lifecycle (create/get/transition/note/task/hypothesis/link/delete/list/summary)
- `tests/unit/reporting/test_reports.py`: 30 tests covering report model, evidence links, attribution, full DRAFT→PUBLISHED lifecycle, immutability enforcement, STIX bundle structure and field correctness, revision creation

**Bug fixes**
- `gnat/investigations/builder.py`: CASE_ID seed expansion passed a list to `normalize()` instead of iterating it (fixed in previous session)
- `gnat/investigations/normalizer.py`: Missing `("threatq", "incident")` dispatch alias — ThreatQ Events are the investigation container but the builder calls `normalize(platform, "incident", ...)` for all CASE_ID seeds
- `gnat/investigations/workspace.py`: `_node_to_stix_base` and Relationship tagging used `obj["key"] = value` item assignment; `STIXBase` only supports `obj.key = value` attribute access — fixed, workspace now materialises all nodes correctly (was 0 nodes materialised)

**Example**
- `docs/tutorials/investigation_xsoar_tq_gm_powerbi.py`: End-to-end cross-platform investigation script (XSOAR + ThreatQ + GreyMatter → EvidenceGraph → workspace → Power BI xlsx); `--mock` flag for dry runs without live credentials; completeness check verifying 14 investigation methods across 3 platforms

### Added — Analysis Layer (Phase 3: Correlation Engine + Analyst Assistance)

- `IndicatorRecord`: lightweight dataclass for platform-sourced IOC records with platform, ioc_type, value, confidence, tags, and first/last seen timestamps
- `EntityGroup`: aggregated view of cross-platform aliases; exposes `platforms`, `is_cross_platform`, `max_confidence`, `all_tags` properties
- `RelationshipScorer`: scores entity-to-entity relationships using co-occurrence (0/0/15/30/45 pts for 1–4+ platforms), recency (≤7d=25pts, ≤30d=15pts, ≤90d=5pts), and source-reliability bonus (+10 if all ≥ B_USUALLY_RELIABLE); output is a `ConfidenceScore`
- `ClusterDetector`: rule-based heuristic clustering of `EntityGroup` objects via shared /24 subnet, shared tags, platform co-occurrence, and timing proximity (72-hour window); BFS connected-component grouping; `Cluster` dataclass with member IDs, signals list, and confidence score
- `EnrichmentDispatcher`: fan-out enrichment across registered connectors; tries `search_indicators_by_value` → `search_observables_by_value` → `list_objects` in priority order; fully best-effort (errors logged, never raised); returns `EnrichmentResult` dict per platform

**`gnat.analysis.timeline` — Chronological event reconstruction**
- `TimelineBuilder`: reconstructs investigation timelines from `Investigation` objects (opened/notes/tasks/closed), `EvidenceGraph` nodes (via `time_window` and `stix` metadata), and raw records (arbitrary timestamp + title fields)
- `TimelineEvent`: dataclass with timestamp, event_type, title, source, description, and linked_artifacts
- `TimelineEventType` enum: 14 event types covering incident/investigation lifecycle, analyst actions, and observables

- `GraphContext`: results container with nodes dict, edges list, seed_ids; `platforms()`, `node_count`, `edge_count` properties; `to_dict()` for API serialisation
- `GraphQuery.shortest_path()`: BFS shortest-path between any two nodes

**`gnat.analysis.copilot` — Analyst assistance**
- `GapDetector`: 8 rule-based evidence gap detection rules (no-evidence/CRITICAL, lateral-movement-no-host/HIGH, exfiltration-no-network/HIGH, attribution-no-ttp/HIGH, ransomware-no-hash/MEDIUM, phishing-no-email-or-domain/MEDIUM, c2-no-network-ioc/HIGH, no-campaign-linkage/LOW); `detect()` per hypothesis, `detect_all()` across all hypotheses, `summary()` counts by severity
- `GapRecommendation`: dataclass with rule_id, severity, description, suggested_action
- `ReportDraftingAssistant`: LLM-backed executive summary and key-findings narrative drafting; graceful fallback (placeholder text + warning) when no LLM configured; two-call `draft_full()` for merged results; configurable prompt templates; evidence capped at 20 links to avoid token explosion
- `DraftResult`: output dataclass with executive_summary, key_findings_narrative, model, prompt/completion token counts, and warnings

### Added — Dissemination Layer (Phase 4)

**`gnat.dissemination.export` — Report export**
- `ExportService`: exports published intelligence reports to STIX 2.1 bundle, GNAT JSON, or PDF; uses cached `stix_bundle_json` when available; SHA-256 checksum on all outputs

- `build_taxii_router()`: FastAPI router implementing all six TAXII 2.1 read-only endpoints (Discovery, API Root, Collections list/metadata, Objects, Manifest); offset-based pagination with base64 cursor; `application/taxii+json;version=2.1` content type
- ADR-0035: FastAPI over dedicated TAXII library; TLP-based collection model; single-process TAXII+API mount

**`gnat.dissemination.notify` — Webhook notifications**
- `WebhookNotifier`: fan-out HTTP POST notifications to registered subscribers; TLP-level access control per subscriber; HMAC-SHA256 `X-GNAT-Signature` header when secret configured; best-effort delivery (errors logged, never raised)
